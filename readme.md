# About these resources
These are the initial resources needed to start working with the 4k framework. More might get added on request.

## Omega Zones KML

The KML displaying the Omega Zones in Google Earth. Needs to be optimized ( = made smaller, under 10mb) to render in Google Maps. It comes in three versions;

- **Original** *(OmegaZones2008-2.kml)*
- **Minimized** Without unnecessary information *(OmegaZones2008-2-minimized.kml)*
- **Line Only** Doesn't fill polygons and only shows lines, performs better in Google Earth *(OmegaZones2008-2-lineonly.kml)*
